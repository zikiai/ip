# Zikiai UI Test Plan

The cases below continue to test the console entry point `zikiai.Zikiai`, which
uses the same command-response handler as the GUI. The runner resolves JavaFX
compile dependencies through Gradle, then compiles into its temporary directory.
Console output and all existing expected results remain unchanged for Level 10.
GUI-specific behavior and smoke tests are documented in `test/gui-test-plan.md`.

The UI test runner starts a fresh chatbot process for each case. Commands are supplied in order, one per line. Expected output is matched exactly after expanding these placeholders:

- `{{SEPARATOR}}`: 60 underscore characters
- `{{BANNER}}`: the five-line Zikiai banner

A case can include an optional `Initial data file` block to seed `data/zikiai.txt` before startup. It can also include an optional `Expected data file` block, which the runner compares with the file after the commands finish.
