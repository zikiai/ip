# Zikiai

Zikiai is a chatbot project written in Java. Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. Reload the Gradle project, then run `./gradlew run` in IntelliJ's Terminal to open the GUI.
   Alternatively, run `zikiai.Launcher.main()` in the editor. Run `./gradlew runCli`
   for the original console interface, which starts with this banner:
   ```
    _____ _ _    _       _
   |__  /(_) | _(_) __ _(_)
     / / | | |/ / |/ _` | |
    / /_ | |   <| | (_| | |
   /____||_|_|\_\_|\__,_|_|
   ```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

## Checking code style and running tests

Use JDK 25 and run these commands from the project root (the folder containing
`build.gradle`):

```bash
./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest
./gradlew check
./gradlew guiTest
```

The first command checks production and test Java code for style violations.
The second runs both Checkstyle and the non-GUI JUnit tests. `./gradlew build` also
includes these checks. The third runs the JavaFX smoke tests and requires a
graphical desktop; it briefly opens a test window with temporary task data.
On Windows, replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`.
Any Checkstyle errors or warnings fail the build.

Checkstyle 11.0.0 uses the rules in `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml` and the
test Javadoc exceptions in `config/checkstyle/suppressions.xml`. These files
come from [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle),
following the [SE-EDU setup tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html).
The import configuration additionally groups JavaFX with third-party imports.
The configuration complements code review; passing Checkstyle does not prove
that every coding-standard rule or program behavior is correct.

Open the generated reports in a browser to see violations and their locations:

- `build/reports/checkstyle/main.html`
- `build/reports/checkstyle/test.html`
- `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` (JUnit results)
- `build/reports/tests/guiTest/index.html` (GUI smoke tests)
- `build/reports/gui/window.png` (GUI smoke-test snapshot)

For optional editor feedback in IntelliJ, install **Checkstyle-IDEA**, select
Checkstyle **11.0.0**, and activate the local `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`
configuration under **Settings > Tools > Checkstyle**. Include test sources in
the scan scope. Reload the Gradle project after changing `build.gradle`.

## Using the graphical chatbot

Type a command and click **Send** or press **Enter**. All existing commands work:
`todo`, `deadline`, `event`, `list`, `find`, `mark`, `unmark`, and `delete`.
For example, try `todo read book`, then `mark 1`, then `list`.

Empty submissions are ignored. `bye` ends the session and disables the input,
leaving the farewell visible until you close the window. A startup loading error
also disables input so the invalid data file cannot be overwritten.

The GUI adapts the FXML, CSS, and avatars from the separate JavaFX tutorial
project. `MainWindow` calls `Zikiai.getResponse(input)` once per submission;
the same command processing and response formatting serve the console interface.
Both interfaces use `data/zikiai.txt`, relative to the working directory.
Do not run multiple sessions against that file at the same time.

## Creating an executable JAR

Zikiai uses the Shadow plugin to create a self-contained JAR containing the
application and its runtime dependencies.
The JAR opens the GUI through `zikiai.Launcher`. JavaFX native libraries are
selected for the build machine's operating system and CPU architecture: this
JAR is platform-specific, so build on the target platform for distribution.

From the project root, build the JAR using:

```bash
./gradlew clean shadowJar
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat clean shadowJar` instead. The generated JAR is:

```text
build/libs/zikiai.jar
```

To run the JAR as a distributed application:

1. Copy `zikiai.jar` into an empty folder.
2. Open a terminal in that folder.
3. Run the following command using JDK 25:

   ```bash
   java -jar "zikiai.jar"
   ```

Zikiai creates its `data` folder relative to the folder from which the JAR is
run. Do not commit the generated JAR or the `build` folder to Git. For a GitHub
release, attach `build/libs/zikiai.jar` as the release binary instead.
